USER INSTRUCTIONS:
- The flamingo is running away from a deadly 'Dalek' in the destroyed 'field of Trenzalore'.

- Help it jump and avoid obstacle by pressing <SPACEBAR> or <UP> arrow key on your keyboard.
- You can also do that by clicking anywhere on the game window.

- If you fail to avoid a grass, the flamingo will be slowed down. The dalek will catch up shouting at you.
- When it has catched up, if you stumble on another grass again. You will be 'EXTERMINATED'. 
  That's GAME OVER :D
- But don't worry, the Dalek will fall back offscreen after you have avoided several obstacles.

- If you fail to avoid a head of 'Cyberman' or the 'Weeping Angel' statue. 
  That would kill you. Also, GAME OVER :D

- When you lose, your score will be showed on the screen. Take a picture of it. Show it to your friends. Dare them XD

- Lastly, enjoy the game and have a nice day XD
